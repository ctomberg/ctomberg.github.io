                <div class="col1">July 16, 1872</div>
            <div class="col2">Roald Engelbregt Gravning Amundsen is born in Borge, &#216;stfold, Norway</div>
                <div class="col1">August 16, 1897 - November 5, 1899</div>
                <div class="col2">Amundsen joins Adrien de Gerlache's Antarctic expedition as mate.  The crew departs Antwerp, Belgium aboard the <em>RV Belgica</em> and is trapped in the ice off Peter I Island for seven months.  Two of the crew perish during the expedition.</div>
                <div class="col1">June 16, 1903 - August 31, 1906</div>
                <div class="col2">A new expedition is led by Amundsen to navigate the Northwest Passage.  The <em>Gj&#248;a</em> is sailed from Oslofjord, Norway to King William Island, Nunavut and on to Nome, Alaska.  The ship is iced in for nearly two years south of King William Island and again for eight months near Hershel Island, Yukon.  Amundsen leaves the expedition for three months while iced-in at Hershel Island and skis 800km to Eagle City, Alaska where there was a telegraph station.  He returns to the iced-in <em>Gj&#248;a</em> and sails to Nome and then San Francisco.  The <em>Gj&#248;a</em> was sold in San Francisco and displayed in Golden Gate Park.</div>
                <div class="col1">April 21, 1908</div>
                <div class="col2">US explorer Frederick Cook claims to reach the North Pole.  No convincing proof was produced and the claim was not widely accepted.</div>
                <div class="col1">November 10, 1908</div>
                <div class="col2">Amundsen makes public plans to reach the North Pole in the vessel <em>Fram</em> by sailing north from Point Barrow and drifting in the sea ice for four or five years.  The plans were inspired by an unsuccesful attempt by Fridjtof Nansen to cross the North Pole by drifting the <em>Fram</em> through the sea ice off the Siberian coast towards Greenland.  Amundsen receives financial support from the King of Norway and the Norwegian parliament.</div>
                <div class="col1">April 6, 1909</div>
                <div class="col2">Robert Peary claims to reach the North Pole with Matthew Henson.  They were widely credited with the accomplishment but the claim became, and remains, disputed and controversial.</div>

                <div class="col2">Amundsen plans journey to the South Pole.</div>

                <div class="col2">Before departing from Portugal, Amundsen advises crew they are sailing to Antarctica instead of around Cape Horn to Arctic.  Amundsen sends a telegram to English rival explorer Robert F. Scott: <q>beg to inform you <em>Fram</em> proceeding Antarctic - Amundsen.</q> When news of Amundsen's change of plans reach Norway, the government, press, and public reaction is almost completely unfavorable</div>
                <div class="col1">January 14, 1911</div>
                <div class="col2">The expedition reaches Bay of Whales, Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica.  The <em>Fram</em> is anchored in the bay and the crew spends the next eleven months establishing and supplying a line of depots toward the South Pole.</div>
                <div class="col1">December 14, 1911</div>
                <div class="col2">Amundsen and his team reach the South Pole.  A flag, and letter kept in a small tent, were left to demonstrate the accomplishment.  Robert Falcon Scott's team discovered these items on January 17, 1912.  Scott's expedition began at Cape Evans, 200 miles west of Bay of Whales and 60 miles farther from the pole.  The team led by Scott perished on the return trip from the pole on or about March 29, 1912.</em></div>
